## CI-001 · 2026-10-10 · Missing producer dependency graph

- Symptom: PR #2 passes the Maven install and all 18 unit tests, then fails the
  downstream impact step with HTTP 404.
- Minimal reproduction: request
  `https://codefloe.com/Vidocq/dep-graph/raw/branch/main/data/Vidocq_peano.json`.
  The global `graph/inverted.json` and `scripts/resolve_impact.py` both return 200.
- Cause: the new Peano repository has not published its producer metadata;
  the dependency update workflow has no prior run.
- Status: producer metadata initialized successfully by workflow run 8
  (`update-dep-graph.yml` on `main`); the file now returns 200 and lists
  `peano-core` and `peano-parent`. PR validation must confirm downstream recovery.
- Evidence: PR validation run 7, job `pr-validate`, fails after `BUILD SUCCESS`.
